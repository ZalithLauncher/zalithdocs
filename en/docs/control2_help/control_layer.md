A control layer is the container for [controls](/en/docs/control2_help/controls); all controls must be placed on a control layer.  
Similar to "layers" in drawing software, control layers help you easily achieve the following:  
- Manage and organize controls across different layers.  
- Implement layered display, hiding, or independent operation of controls.

Control layers do not have a size concept—they always cover the entire screen.

## Creating a Control Layer

In the menu on the right, click the "Create New" button to create a new control layer.

You can click on a control layer to select it, the selected layer will be highlighted with a bold border.  
To add controls to a layer, you must first select that control layer.  

Control layers have a stacking order, they are loaded from bottom to top.  
You can drag and reorder layers as needed.

Each control layer has its own set of properties, which can be used to create powerful and flexible behaviors:
